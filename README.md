# CSS Adapter Demo

Projects that use CSS frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Material Design](https://material.io/) typically litter their markup templates with framework-specific CSS classes. This heavily clutters the markup for developers and increases maintenance for UX. This project demonstrates how to abstract this away by using a SCSS adapter.

## Getting started

Build the CSS:

```
npm build
```

Launch the demo:

```
npm start
```
